# Spatio-Temporal Forecasting

This repository contains an implementaation of the MetNet-2 model. The default arguments are geared towards using the WeatherBench dataset, which is not included. 

## Dependencies

Please see the requirements.txt file. Note: If you are planning on using a different dataset, avoid installing dataset-specific dependencies to avoid collisions. 

### Usage

Using the MetNet-2 model requires configuring the input arguments for your tailored use-case. The current main.py script is designed to be used with wandb for monitoring during training.
